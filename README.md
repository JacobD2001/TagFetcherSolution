# TagFetcherSolution 🚀

Welcome to the TagFetcherSolution! This application is designed to be fun and easy to use. The project is separated into 4 main projects: Application Layer, Infrastructure Layer, Domain Layer, making the code ripe for further development and maintaining the codebase well-structured and organized.

Follow the steps below to get started and dive into the world of tags. 

## Getting Started 🛠

To run the app, please follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    - Use the command below to clone the repository:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/JacobD2001/TagFetcherSolution.git
      ```

2. **Run the App in a Docker Container** 🐳
    - Hit `F5` in your preferred IDE to run the app in a Docker container. It's that easy!

3. **Time to Have Fun** 🎉
    - Now that the app is running, you're all set to explore and enjoy its features.

## Additional Information ℹ️

- **Endpoints**: Utilize the given endpoints to perform the operations you desire. For detailed instructions of the API, there's OpenAPI documentation added to the project, making it super easy to follow along.

- **Docker Compose**: The app should work flawlessly with `docker compose up`. However, in this scenario, you'll need to create the database manually, as the database is created with migrations applied when running the project.

## Possible Ways of Further Development 🌱

Here are a few ideas on how you could further enhance this project:

- **Add Logging to API**: Implementing logging will help in monitoring and debugging the application more efficiently.

- **Configure Docker Compose Up for Migrations**: Adjusting `docker compose up` to apply migrations automatically would make the setup process smoother. This improvement would ensure the app is well containerized and functions seamlessly across all devices, fulfilling the purpose of Docker.
